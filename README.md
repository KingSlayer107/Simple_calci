simple calculator in c

This C program performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation) between two user-inputted numbers. The user is prompted to enter two numbers and an operator symbol (+, -, *, /, ^) to specify the desired operation. The program uses a switch statement to execute the corresponding operation. It handles division by zero with an error message and uses the pow function for exponentiation. The result of the calculation is then printed to the console.
